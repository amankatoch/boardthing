BoardThing
==========

The new version of Boardthing.


About ---------------

This will be the build for the newest version of BoardThing. We intend to build off what we've learned to create version 2.0. The idea is to keep the same brainstorming functionality but allow those planning sessions to be fleshed out further with multiple optionally programmable boards. Think Powerpoint crossed with HyperCard.


Frameworks ---------------

Initially the main board listing page was built using AngularJS and the main board was wrote with Backbone.js. The new version will ony be using Backbone.js.
